This repository contains the code related to the manuscript [_"Variational measurement-based quantum computation for generative modeling"_](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2310.13524.pdf). The article mainly talks about the applications of quantum circuits based on [Measurement-Based Quantum Computation](https://journals.aps.org/prl/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevLett.86.5188) in the realm of generative modeling. All the simulations are implemented using [Pennylane](https://pennylane.ai/) and [pytorch](https://pytorch.org/).

This repository contains the code related to the manuscript [_"Variational measurement-based quantum computation for generative modeling"_](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2310.13524.pdf). An overview of this work is provided below, but in brief, the work solves a number of semi-definite programs (SDPs) related to [Measurement-Based Quantum Computation](https://journals.aps.org/prl/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevLett.86.5188). All the simulations are implemented using [Pennylane](https://pennylane.ai/) and [pytorch](https://pytorch.org/).
